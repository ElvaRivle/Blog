Let's say you're working with a few Github repos at once and you want to easily jump to pull requests of each. Or you want to take a rest and easily jump to one of your favorite subreddits for a bit. You don't need to create a bunch of bookmarks for all of them, you just need one! 

# Parametrized bookmarks

You create a bookmark like so: https://github.com/org-name/%s/pulls, you give it a name, for example, "*pulls*" and type "*pulls service-name*" in the address bar. You press enter and lo and behold, you will be properly pointed to the https://github.com/org-name/service-name/pulls website.

Same thing for the Reddit example. You create a bookmark like so: https://old.reddit.com/r/%s, you give it a name, for example, "*reddit*" and type "*reddit subreddit-name*". (Yes, I've used https://old.reddit.com, the superior version of Reddit ðŸ˜„)

Notice the `%s` format specifier. If you've worked with C language in the past, you'll know that it denotes some string of arbitrary length. So whatever you write after the bookmark name, it will be placed instead of `%s` format specifier. 

I've covered 3 of the most used web browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome and Edge. The same thing can be accomplished with Brave, while other browsers haven't been explored.

# Firefox

Go to `Bookmarks` -> `Manage bookmarks` from the hamburger menu and create a new bookmark like so:

<img src="{{ '/img/parametrized-bookmarks-post/new-bookmark-firefox.png' | url }}" alt="New bookmark in Firefox" width="100%" height="auto" />

Then simply write "*pulls*" in the address bar and add the repo name, like so:

<img src="{{ '/img/parametrized-bookmarks-post/bookmark-address-bar-firefox.png' | url }}" alt="Parametrized bookmark in Firefox's address bar" width="100%" height="auto" />

You notice straight away that the browser nows exactly where to go, to https://github.com. 

# Google Chrome

In Google Chrome, it's a bit more complicated. 

Enter chrome://settings/searchEngines into the address bar. There is a Site Search at the bottom. Click on add and fill in the fields, like so:

<img src="{{ '/img/parametrized-bookmarks-post/new-bookmark-chrome.png' | url }}" alt="New bookmark in Chrome" width="100%" height="auto" />

The end result should be exactly the same as in the Firefox.

# Microsoft Edge

The same process as for the Google Chrome, except for the settings url, which is: edge://settings/searchEngines
