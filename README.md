# Who Am I?

Hi! I'm Elvir Vlahovljak, a passionate software developer from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I had a lifelong fascination for games and computers. This passion sparked my journey into software development back in 2016, leveraging a solid understanding of computer fundamentals.

I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo. My primary field of work is backend development, while looking forward to learn system design and to expand my knowledge in ops side of devops. I've successfully tackled many challenges so far, and not afraid to face the future ones.

I'm currently working as a software developer in Bloomteq where I learn a bunch of new things on a weekly basis. By starting this blog, I hope to solidify my understanding of the topics I learn and to spark some constructive comments. That's not the only goal. I also hope that you will benefit greatly from the topics mentioned here.

Hope you'll enjoy!
